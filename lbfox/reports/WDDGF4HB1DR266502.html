 <strong>Description: </strong>
 Mercedes-Benz USA is recalling certain MY 2009-2013 C-Class, E-Class, GLK-Class, SLS-Class and E-Class Coupe and Cabriolet Mercedes-Benz vehicles equipped with passenger-side frontal airbags affected by the defect decision of TK Holdings, Inc. (Takata). Under certain circumstances during a crash that necessitates frontal airbag deployment, the defect in your passenger-side frontal airbag inflator may cause the inflator housing to rupture. A passenger-side inflator explosion during deployment could result in metal fragments striking the front passenger or other occupants, possibly causing serious injury or death.

 <dt id="FederalOdometerAct"><a name="TRUTHMILEAGE"></a>Federal Odometer Act</dt>
 <dd>
 The Federal Odometer Act requires a seller to disclose the vehicle's mileage on the title when ownership is transferred. Congress enacted this Act to prohibit odometer tampering and to protect consumers from mileage fraud. Under this act, sellers must disclose any issues with the vehicle's odometer. These disclosures translate into the Exceed Mechanical Limits and Not Actual Mileage titles.

 <dt id="OwnershipHistory"><a name="OWNERSHIPHISTORY"></a>Ownership History</dt>
 <dd>
 CARFAX defines an owner as an individual or business that possesses and uses a vehicle. Not all title transactions represent changes in ownership. To provide estimated number of owners, CARFAX proprietary technology analyzes all the events in a vehicle history. Estimated ownership is available for vehicles manufactured after 1991 and titled solely in the US including Puerto Rico. Dealers sometimes opt to take ownership of a vehicle and are required to in the following states: Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Dakota. Please consider this as you review a vehicle's estimated ownership history.

 <dt id="SalvageTitle"><a name="SALVAGETITLE"></a>Salvage Title</dt>
 <dd>
 A Salvage Title is issued on a vehicle damaged to the extent that the cost of repairing the vehicle exceeds approximately 75% of its pre-damage value. This damage threshold may vary by state. Some states treat Junk titles the same as Salvage but the majority use this title to indicate that a vehicle is not road worthy and cannot be titled again in that state. The following eleven states also use Salvage titles to identify stolen vehicles - AZ, FL, GA, IL, MD, MN, NJ, NM, NY, OK and OR.
 
 </dd>
 <dt id="TitleIssued"><a name="TITLEISSUED"></a>Title Issued</dt>
 <dd>
 A state issues a title to provide a vehicle owner with proof of ownership. Each title has a unique number. Each title or registration record on a CARFAX report does not necessarily indicate a change in ownership. In Canada, a registration and bill of sale are used as proof of ownership.
 
 </dd>
 <dt id="TotalLossVehicle"><a name="TOTALLOSS"></a>Total Loss Vehicle</dt>
 <dd>
 An insurance or fleet company declares a vehicle a total loss when a claim exceeds approximately 75% of its pre-damage value or if the vehicle is stolen and not recovered. This damage threshold varies by company. These companies typically take possession and obtain the title. Not all total loss vehicles result in a DMV-reported branded title. This may occur when an insurance company's definition of a total loss is different than the state DMV's definition for a branded title or when the owner of the vehicle is a self-insured company, like a fleet or rental company.
